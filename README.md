# Better Call Jin!

This repository was created to share materials I developed while mentoring a Ph.D. student in a Neuroscience Program.

As part of the mentoring experience, we held two scheduled sessions per week (~ 1 hour per session), where we discussed a variety of topics, including but not limited to statistics, coding (primarily using MATLAB to visualize EEG data saved in `.set` files), data visualization and wrangling (using SPSS), and other graduate school-related matters.

In addition to the materials posted in this repository, a separate Google document is regularly updated. The document contains the student's questions related to research techniques, to which I provide written responses, followed by in-person discussions as needed.

The image was crated by ChatGPT. Using generative AI to enhance research is another topic of discussion.
